# Onboarding FAQ (for RAG)

### Why do you need my date of birth?
We use it to determine if parental consent is required for publishing your profile.

### I made a typo in my email—how do I fix it?
Tell me the correct email and I’ll update it, e.g., “Change my email to **alex.lee@gmail.com**.”

### How do I change my graduation year?
Say “Set my graduation year to **2027**,” and I’ll confirm the update.

### Do I have to share my gender?
No. You can select **Prefer not to say**.

### I’m under 18. What happens next?
I’ll need a parent or guardian’s email. I’ll send them a consent request before your profile is published.

### Can you help with scholarships or homework?
No—Summit only assists with onboarding. I can help finish your profile setup instead.
